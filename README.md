# Licence-Plate-Detection-using-TensorFlow-Lite

This is a Python project that uses TensorFlow Lite to detect and recognize license plates from images or videos. nd Alexey Gruzdev.

# Custom Dataset to train the model
Use your custom dataset to train your Custom Model. Check out the Custom_TFLite2_Object_Detction_Model Colab Notebook, detailed explanation is given on how to create custom dataset

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies to run:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.8.0 or higher
- TensorFlow Lite
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

You can install them using pip or conda.



## Usage

To run the project, you need to clone or download the repository from GitHub. Then follow the following command :

```
cd custom_model_lite
```
```
python LicenseDetector.py
```
License Plate will be detected on a a Demo video and will be shown as an output in a window
